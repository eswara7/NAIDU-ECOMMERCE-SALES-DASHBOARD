A comprehensive business analysis project where I developed a sales dashboard using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python** to help guide business decisions for my friend's father in his eCommerce venture. This project involved analyzing sales data, cleaning it, and visualizing key performance metrics to provide valuable insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

In this project, I worked with an eCommerce sales dataset to create an insightful dashboard that helps in understanding sales trends and performance. The main goal was to provide actionable insights for better business decision-making by analyzing product sales, customer behavior, and revenue.

## üîç Data Analysis Process

The data analysis process was split into several stages:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Imported and cleaned the dataset (spreadsheet) to remove missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns.
   - Converted data types and formatted the dataset for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted exploratory analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to uncover trends, outliers, and patterns in the sales data.
   - Used **SQL** queries to perform deeper analysis and aggregation, particularly for handling larger data sets.
   - Analyzed metrics like total sales, revenue, profit margins, and sales by product, region, and time.

3. **Key Business Metrics**:
   - **Total Sales**: Aggregated total sales by product and customer.
   - **Revenue & Profit**: Identified high-performing products and sales channels.
   - **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzed customer buying behavior to create targeted strategies for marketing and promotions.
   - **Product Performance**: Identified top-selling products and those with low sales.

## üìà Power BI Dashboard

I developed a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize the following:

- **Sales Performance**: Displays key sales metrics like total revenue, profit, and sales over time.
- **Product Analysis**: Interactive charts to compare product performance, identify top sellers, and highlight low-performing items.
- **Customer Insights**: Data visualizations showing customer purchasing trends and segmentation.
- **Geographical Performance**: Visualized regional sales distribution to spot location-based opportunities.

The dashboard allows users to drill down into specific metrics and get a granular view of the business performance, enabling better decision-making.

## üîß Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For building interactive and dynamic visualizations and dashboards.
- **SQL**: To query the dataset and perform complex aggregations and data manipulations.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## üöÄ Skills Developed

This project helped me develop valuable skills in:

- **Power BI**: Building interactive dashboards and reports to display data insights effectively.
- **SQL**: Writing complex queries for data extraction, aggregation, and manipulation.
- **Python**: Performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.
- **Business Analysis**: Translating raw data into actionable insights for business decision-making.

## üìã Key Features of the Dashboard

- **Sales Summary**: Displays total sales, revenue, profit, and cost breakdowns.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends to spot seasonality and performance over time.
- **Top Products**: Highlights high-performing products based on sales volume and revenue.
- **Customer Insights**: Segmentation based on purchasing behavior and customer demographics.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Regional sales performance and market opportunities.
